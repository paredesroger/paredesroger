abstract = {Summary Reliability and risk assessment of lifeline systems call for efficient methods that integrate hazard and interdependencies. Such methods are computationally challenged when the probabilistic response of systems is tied to multiple events, as performance quantification requires a large catalog of ground motions. Available methods to address this issue use catalog reductions and importance sampling. However, besides comparisons against baseline Monte Carlo trials in select cases, there is no guarantee that such methods will perform or scale well in practice. This paper proposes a new efficient method for reliability assessment of interdependent lifeline systems, termed RAILS, that considers systemic performance and is particularly effective when dealing with large catalogs of events. RAILS uses the state-space partition method to estimate systemic reliability with theoretical bounds and, for the first time, supports cyclic interdependencies among lifeline systems. Recycling computations across an entire seismic catalog with RAILS considerably reduces the number of system performance evaluations in seismic performance studies. Also, when performance estimate bounds are not tight, we adopt an importance and stratified sampling method that in our computational experiments is various orders of magnitude more efficient than crude Monte Carlo. We assess the efficiency of RAILS using synthetic networks and illustrate its application to quantify the seismic risk of realistic yet streamlined systems hypothetically located in the San Francisco Bay Region.},
