abstract = {This paper introduces and compares two frameworks for evaluating and quantifying the network fragility and resilience of large, high-voltage transmission grids, with example applications given for validating synthetic test case datasets. The first framework uses an all-terminal reliability metric based on graph-theoretic probabilistic connectivity analysis, allowing for a more precise determination of the distribution and edge cases of fragility. The other network resilience framework considered here analyzes maximal load delivery capability, as evaluated by a linearized optimal power flow analysis that allows load shedding. This analysis is performed under multiple component outage conditions, along the full spectrum from ordinary operation to complete non-availability of the extra-high voltage grid. The range of results indicates grid performance under three types of outage sets: planned outages, random outages, and targeted outages. Example results for the North-Central area of the 2000-bus synthetic Texas test case show the application of the two methods.},
